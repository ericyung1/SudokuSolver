# SudokuSolver
This project examines the runtime of two Sudoku solvers: a naive solution and a backtracking solution. The naive solution tests all possible combinations of the digits 1-9 in every empty cell, while the backtracking solution stops at specific digits that cannot satisfy the row/column and tries again.
