# SudokuSolver
This project examines the runtime of two Sudoku solvers: a naive solution and a backtracking solution. The naive solution tests all possible combinations of the digits 1-9 in every empty cell, while the backtracking solution stops at specific digits that cannot satisfy the row/column and tries again. Surprisingly, the time complexity of both algorithms is O(n^2), but very rarely does the backtracking solver reach its upper bound. In fact, the naive solver takes a significantly longer period of time to solve the exact same sudoku board as the backtracking solution.
